# dynamicshrink-package

Here, I present the experimental R-package "dynamicshrink" associated with my master's thesis entitled "Dynamic Shrinkage in Bayesian Structural Time Series and Vector Autoregressive Models". Please find a copy of my thesis in this repository.

This sort of experimental package allows firstly to replicate the results obtained in my thesis and, eventually, to perform further analysis on high dimensional time series. The adjective “experimental” used here refers to the fact that, even though the great efforts to make these functions high performing, I acknowledge that there is room for improvements in terms of computational time. The code, which is entirely written in R, recalls for some specific tasks high-performing functions provided by other popular packages. Reference R packages are: dlm, stochvol and matlib, MASS, Rcpp and the tidyverse. Further developments in C will eventually follow.

Further info on the package usage can be found in Chapter 5 of my thesis and in Appendix.
