# dynamicshrink-package

Here, I present the experimental R-package "dynamicshrink" associated with my master's thesis entitled "Dynamic Shrinkage in Bayesian Structural Time Series and Vector Autoregressive Models".

This experimental package allows to replicate the results obtained in my thesis and, eventually, to perform further analysis on high dimensional time series. The reason why I call it “experimental” is that, even though the great efforts to make these functions high performing, I acknowledge that there is still room for improvements. Ideally, I would like to write some functions in C++.

Some R packages I used in this project are: dlm, stochvol and matlib, MASS, Rcpp and the tidyverse.

Further info on the package usage can be found in Chapter 5 of my thesis and in Appendix.
